                    <h3>Starting</h3>
                    <p>Real Madrid Club de Fútbol is a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain.The club was formed in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, and played its first competitive match on 13 May 1902, when it lost 3–1 in the semi-final of the Campeonato de Copa de S.M. Alfonso XIII against FC Barcelona.[1] Real Madrid played against other local clubs in various regional tournaments, that served as qualifiers for the Copa del Rey, from 1902 to 1940. In 1929, the club became one of the founding members of La Liga, Spain's first national league. As of 2024, Real is one of only three clubs never to have been relegated from the top level of Spanish football, the others being Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona.</p>

            <p>Real Madrid CF has probably achieved all a football club could. With a record 35 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey trophies, a sensational 14 European Cups/Champions Leagues and 2 UEFA Cups, Real are second to none in a competition for the greatest football club of all time. While the club enjoys fierce rivalries with Barcelona (El Clásico) and Atlético Madrid (El Derbi Madrileño), Real has been the most supported club in the country for the majority of its history. Many of the best players in the world have played in the clubs white shirts, including legends like Alfredo Di Stéfano and Ferenc Puskás.</p>
            
            <h3>Presidency of Santiago Bernabeu</h3>
            <p>Santiago Bernabeu was first a player and then president, but it was in his position in the director's box that he would go down in the club's history.He was a visionary who took the club to feats never before imagined. In September 1943, he was elected president and after a slow start his decisions still started to bear fruit.He made a huge effort to establish a competition between the best teams in Europe which resulted in the creation of the European Cup. Los Blancos won the first five editions, gaining great notoriety across the continent.He signed a generation of footballers who made history in Madrid: Alfredo Di Stefano, Paco Gento, Ferenc Puskas and those who came after.During his tenure, Bernabeu won 30 trophies until he died in 1978 and the club's stadium now bears his name.</p>

            <h3>The first six European Cups</h3>
            <p>Real Madrid ripped through Europe without mercy in the early years of the European Cup, winning the first five editions.Five successive triumphs in the competition is an achievement that has yet to be repeated, and the team of Di Stefano, Gento, Hector Rial, Raymond Kopa, Puskas, Jose Maria Zarraga, Rafael Lesmes and Jose Santamaria won title after title.After a number of lean years as the team was rebuilt, Gento was still around as the team won a sixth continental trophy in 1966.</p>

            <h3>The seventh, eighth and ninth Champions League trophies</h3>
            <p>Once the Butragueno era passed, Raul Gonzalez emerged with an explosive eye for goal. He was able to do something that the previous generation couldn't as he won the Champions League in 1998.It ended a 32-year wait for the most prestigious European trophy, and then Los Merengues found their touch once more, winning three out of five editions with further success coming in Paris in 2000 and Glasgow in 2002.</p>
            
            <h3>The Galacticos</h3>
            <p>In 2003, Florentino Perez sanctioned the signing of David Beckham and a year later Michael Owen arrived. These blockbuster signings followed Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo Nazario, as well as the controversial arrival of Luis Figo in Madrid.Perez constructed this team of Galacticos at a time when sports marketing was a business that was exploding. These signings brought huge economic benefits to the club, but they couldn't bring success on the pitch.Many Saturday afternoons saw the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu baked in sunshine with fans watching some of the greatest footballers to play the game all playing together. Yet they couldn't get their hands on the Champions League, suffering incredibly painful knockout defeats in the mid-2000s.</p>

            <h3>The signing of Cristiano Ronaldo</h3>
            <p>Perez returned for another term as president in 2009, and he looked to make a statement immediately. He did so by signing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for a world record 96 million euros.Ronaldo had established himself as the best footballer in the world at that time, guiding United to Champions League success in 2008, and Real Madrid felt they had signed the player who could end their barren run in Europe.It would prove to be an astute signing as Ronaldo scored 451 goals in 438 games, which averages more than one per game, and he was the iconic figure behind one of the most successful eras in the club's history.He broke every single goalscoring record in Madrid and placed himself on a level with Di Stefano, and his duel with Lionel Messi at the same time has probably been one of the most electrifying rivalries in sport.</p>

            <h3>Three successive Champions League trophies</h3>
            <p>Two years after Lisbon, Real Madrid were in the final of the Champions League once more. Zinedine Zidane had taken charge in January of 2016 and it was to be Atletico Madrid who stood in the club's way of European glory.A penalty shoot-out in Milan was an agonising watch for supporters, but Cristiano Ronaldo stepped up and scored the decisive penalty. This was Champions League number one for Zidane.In 2017 it was Juventus who were the club's opponents in Cardiff, and this was a rather more one-sided affair with the Spanish giants winning 4-1.In 2018, Zidane was living through a difficult time in the Spanish capital as his side struggled domestically, but somehow his team were in the Champions League final once again.After becoming the first team to win the tournament back-to-back since AC Milan in the 1990s, Los Blancos would secure their third straight European trophy with a victory over Liverpool in Kiev.A dull game was sparked into life by a horrific Loris Karius mistake which resulted in Karim Benzema's goal, before the German keeper would again parry a Gareth Bale shot into his own net.</p>
